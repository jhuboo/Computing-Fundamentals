## Machine Language

A machine language is an agreed-upon formalism, designed to code low-level
programs as series of machine instructions. It is the most profound interface
in the overall computer as it is the fine line where hardware and software
meet.

Using these instructions, we can command the processor to perform arithmetic
and logic operations, fetch and store values from and to the memory, move
values from one register to another, test Boolean conditions, etc... In
contrast to higher level languages' generality and power of expression, 
machine language is designed to directly execute and fully control the given
underlying hardware. Understanding machine language is essential for a complete
understanding of computer architectures. It is quite incredible how most of
the sophisticated software systems are at their very core just long series of
elementary instructions, each specifying a very simple and primitive operation
in the underlying hardware.
